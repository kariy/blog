What does it take be great? What does it take be someone that changes history? 

What am I so scared of? I know I could've done it.. I know I could've done it better, but why didn't I? 

I think I understand it now... the difference between a great and mediocre person is that a great person is someone who's able to conquer their fears - to still do it even when feelign scared. They are those who are able to do whatever it takes even when all the odds are against them. 

There's no bravery without fear.

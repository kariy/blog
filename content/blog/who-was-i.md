Who was I? What was I like before? Was this always on my mind? The memories of my past self has become blurry.

As I continued, I slowly forgot how I was years before. My devotion was justified by what I believed to be _right_. The reasoning was faithful to my own definition of *it*, but I may have devoted myself to the wrong thing. Next time, I should have chosen my devotions more carefully. 

No.

In the same circumstances, I'd do it again. My willingness to devote is because of the meaningful experiences it has given me, despite everything else.

_This is the first post of my random rambles about my life, or maybe life in general. I'm calling this series of posts as 'Finding Myself`. Don't ask me why I'm giving it such a philosophical-esque name. I just feel like it._

_I intend to make the posts in this series, short. Something that I can write, more or less, in a single sitting. My intention is to write down whatever that comes to my head at the moment, without worrying about the post having any substance._

_My motivation is mainly to get myself into a habit of writing more often to get better at it. Also because recently I realized I like to think a lot about these sort of stuff so why not write about them as well._

For my entire life, I consider myself as someone who's not very good at expressing oneself. My family, especially my mom (love you mom), always told me that I need to talk more about myself and my life. Mainly because I rarely mention about what I do when I go about my day, to any of them, like if I'm going out to hang out with my usual group of friends, it never really occurred to me to tell my mom where I'm going, with who, or what I'm gonna do. Not because I want to hide something but mostly because I don't really think the details are necessary. In my head, I would think, how would that information be useful to them. Well, some information can be useful, yes. Like where I'm going for example. But, most aren't. Though the example I gave is quite a basic one, so there's not much that can be elaborated from that (lol). I'm about 15,164 km away from my home and family, due to my job. Yet, I don't think my family know what I actually do at my job or what my job entails me to do. They just know that I write some codes, that's it. Because I just didn't tell them about the details.

It's not because I'm not close with my family or anything like that. But for some reason, sometimes I just feel embarrassed to talk about my personal life. There's this weird and awkward feeling that prevented me from telling my family more about myself. But for some reason, I don't feel like this when I'm with friends and to be quite honest, I'm more open to my them than to my family. I know a lot of people can sort of relate to this. Something something about you choose who your friends are but you can't choose who you'd want your parents or siblings to be. Hence, why you'd feel more willing to open up with your friends yada yada.

I don't know. There's part of me that thinks I should only tell some parts of myself that I assume my parents would only be proud of. So all the mundane stuff can just be ignored, or rather, be hidden. Though I'm more comfortable with friends, there are still stuff that I wouldn't want to speak to them. It's only the mundane stuff that makes the difference.

My mom would liken this trait of me to that of my dad's. She'd always say, "You're just like your dad. You don't like talking about your life at all", but more in a jokingly yet loving manner. And that's actually true. I definitely see myself in him. He's also not someone that likes to talk about himself or his feelings, and prefers to stay quiet and struggle in silence. To some extent, it's a quality that I genuinely admire.

My dad is a great man. Maybe not so much as a father figure. I'm more comfortable being with my mom than him. Not because I don't like him but it just feel awkward sometimes. Maybe because I can see a slight silhouette of myself in him. But he tries his best you know, and I still love him. So there's that.

My father has 10 siblings (in my country, that is relatively common for his generation). If I remember correctly, he's the 5th or 6th, but among them all, my dad is the person that they consider as the most reliable. If there's an important matter need to be discussed, they need to consult him or at least include him in the dicussion. I feel like my dad have been putting himself in that position voluntarily at this point. Towards his siblings, relatives, friends, and most obviously, our family. Not because he wants to be seen as an important person but maybe he thinks that he NEEDS to be reliable, he NEEDS to be strong, he NEEDS to be able to provide because there's no guarantee that the others will. So, he can't show any weaknesses. And if he feels depressed about anything, it's better to just struggle in silence.

Upon thinking about it, I realized I have been telling myself the same my entire life. Possibly the reason why I don't like talking about myself nor my feelings. But on a smaller scale perhaps.

Honestly, I don't actually know if any of these stories are true. I'm just writing whatever comes to my head, haha. Maybe to some extent they are, and I'm only saying otherwise because I just don't feel good enough about myself to affirm it.
